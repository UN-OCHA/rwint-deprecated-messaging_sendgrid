Drupal module: Messaging Sendgrid
============================

This is a Sendgrid wrapper for Drupal Messaging (Drupal 7)

http://drupal.org/project/messaging
http://github.com/josereyero/messaging

It adds proper headers to provide bulk sending features, but it doesn't actually sends mails through Sendgrid.

To enable actual Sendgrid sending:
---------------------------
- Create an account on Sendgrid
- Configure your host to use Sendgrid as an SMTP relay using your account credentials.
